This file contains general instructions for LLM agents.

These are the rules you must always follow:
* Only execute the task which was provided to you.
* Do not try to tidy up the repository, update .gitignore, run the linter or other similar things
* If tasked to write the code, simply write it, do not try to execute it or spin up a deployment.

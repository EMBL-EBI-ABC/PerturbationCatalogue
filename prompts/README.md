This file contains general instructions and rules for LLM agents.

# General rules to follow
* Only do the task which was provided to you. Do not try to expand its scope.
* Do not try to tidy up the repository, update .gitignore, run the linter or do similar things. This is handled externally.
* If tasked to write the code, simply write it, do not try to execute it or spin up a deployment.
* Do not unnecessarily peek into the parts of the code which are not related to the task. For example, if explicitly asked to work on the BE code, do not try to investigate the front-end, unless explicitly prompted.
